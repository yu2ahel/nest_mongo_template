Understanding the distinction between a model and a Data Transfer Object (DTO) is crucial for designing and structuring
applications efficiently. Here's a breakdown of their primary differences:

### Model

A **model** in software development typically represents the structure of the data entities within an application. It's
often used in connection with a database to define the shape and relationships of data, reflecting how data is organized
and manipulated.

- **Purpose**: Models are used to enforce business logic, data validation, and relationships between different data
  entities in your application.
- **Location**: In the context of an application using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Sequelize,
  TypeORM, or Mongoose, models directly map to database tables/collections and define the schema or structure of these
  database entities.
- **Usage**: Models ensure data integrity and are used throughout the application to interact with the database. They
  often include methods for querying the database and may contain business logic related to the data they represent.

### Example of a Model:

typescript

Copy code

```ts
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

interface IUser {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

const userSchema = new Schema<IUser>({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number, required: false },
});

const UserModel = model<IUser>('User', userSchema);
export default UserModel;
```

.

DON'T FORGET TO IMPORT IT IN THE MODULE and PROVIDE

```ts
@Module({
    imports: [MongooseModule.forFeature([{name: 'User', schema: UserSchema}])],
    providers: [
        {
            provide: 'USER_MODEL',
            useFactory: () => User,
        },
    ],
})
```

Let's take a closer look at the key components:

### `src/controllers/`:

Controllers in our application define routes and what happens when a certain route is called. They
handle the user's request and return a response.

### `src/api-services/`:

API Services are responsible for interacting with external APIs. They handle the communication with
external services, process the data, and return the results to the calling services.

### `src/config/`:

Configuration files and environment variable management. This is where you can store configuration
settings for your application.

### `src/core/`:

Core modules and utilities that are shared across the application. This can include services, utilities,
and other modules that are used in multiple parts of the application.

### `src/dtos/`:

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used for handling and validating data input/output. They define the
structure of the data that is passed between different parts of the application.

### `src/models/`:

Data models define the structure of database entities. They represent the data that is stored in the
database and are used to interact with the database.

### `src/repositories/`:

Repositories are data access layers that interact with the database. They provide methods to retrieve
data from and persist data to the database, hiding the details of the data source.

### `src/services/`:

Services contain business logic and application rules. They are called by controllers and are responsible
for processing data, executing business rules, and calling repositories.

### `src/app.module.ts`:

The root module of the application. This is where you define the structure of your application and import
the necessary modules and components.

### `src/main.ts`:

The entry file of the application. This is where the application is started and the server is created.
